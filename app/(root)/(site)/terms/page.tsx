            <strong>Exhibit A: Binding Arbitration</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            This Exhibit A describes the further provisions which apply to the
            Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver.
          </p>
          <p>
            A.&nbsp;<strong>Disputes</strong>. A dispute is any controversy
            between you and Hallelujah Gospel Sing-Along concerning the
            Services, any software related to the Services, the price of the
            Services, Your account, Hallelujah Gospel Sing-Along’s advertising,
            marketing, or communications, your purchase transaction or billing,
            or any term of this Agreement, under any legal theory including
            contract, warranty, tort, statute, or regulation, except disputes
            relating to the enforcement or validity of your or Hallelujah Gospel
            Sing-Along’s intellectual property rights.As part of the best
            efforts process to resolve disputes, and prior to initiating
            arbitration proceedings, each party agrees to provide notice of the
            dispute to the other party, including a description of the dispute,
            what efforts have been made to resolve it, and what the disputing
            party is requesting as resolution, to&nbsp;
            <em>
              <strong>info@hgsingalong.com</strong>
            </em>
            .
          </p>
          <p>
            B.&nbsp;<strong>Small Claims Court Available</strong>. You may
            initiate an action in your local Small Claims Court if you meets the
            court’s requirements. However, if such a claim is transferred,
            removed or appealed to a different court, Hallelujah Gospel
            Sing-Along reserves the right to require arbitration.
          </p>
          <p>
            C.&nbsp;<strong>Arbitration Procedure</strong>. Disputes not
            resolved pursuant to Section A or B shall be resolved through
            arbitration. The American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) will
            conduct any arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules.
            Arbitration hearings will take place in the federal judicial
            district of your primary business location. A single arbitrator will
            be appointed. The arbitrator must: (a) follow all applicable
            substantive law; (b) follow applicable statutes of limitations; (c)
            honor valid claims of privilege; (d) issue a written decision
            including the reasons for the award. The arbitrator may award
            damages, declaratory or injunctive relief, and costs (including
            reasonable attorneys’ fees). Any arbitration award may be enforced
            (such as through a judgment) in any court with jurisdiction. Under
            AAA Rules, the arbitrator rules on his or her own jurisdiction,
            including the arbitrability of any claim; however, a court has
            exclusiveauthority to enforce the prohibition on arbitration on a
            class-wide basis or in a representative capacity.
          </p>
          <p>
            D.<strong>&nbsp;Arbitration Fees</strong>. If you are unable to
            afford the arbitration costs, Hallelujah Gospel Sing-Along will
            advance those costs to you, subject to the arbitrator’s
            determination if costs should be reimbursed to Hallelujah Gospel
            Sing-Along if Hallelujah Gospel Sing-Along prevails. For disputes
            involving more than $75,000, the AAA rules will govern payment of
            filing fees and the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses.
          </p>
          <p>
            E.&nbsp;<strong>Conflict with AAA Rules</strong>. This Agreement
            governs if there is a conflict with the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration
            Rules.
          </p>
          <p>
            F.&nbsp;<strong>Requirement to File Within One Year</strong>.
            Notwithstanding any other statute of limitations, a claim or dispute
            under this Agreement must be filed in Small Claims Court or noticed
            for arbitration within one year of when it could first be filed, or
            such claim will be permanently barred.
          </p>
          <p>
            G.&nbsp;<strong>Severability</strong>. If the class action waiver is
            found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a
            dispute, then those parts will not be arbitrated but will be
            resolved in court, with the balance resolved through arbitration. If
            any provision of this Exhibit A isfound to be illegal or
            unenforceable, then that provision will be severed; however, the
            remaining provisions shall still apply and shall be interpreted to
            as nearly as possible achieve the original intent of this Exhibit,
            inclusive of the severed provision.
